Discover the time of searhing words in list, binary tree(ordered, unordered and balanced)


My main task was to discover the difference in time using 2 data structures as list and binary tree. The results were obvious even before the program, that binary tree is much faster that simple list. For operations in list I used function list.index and for tree - method find().
